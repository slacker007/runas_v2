# runas_v2
Modified version of Window's runas.  Allows you to specify local or domain credentials to run an executable (spawn a process and its primary thread) as a user of your choice.  Program is designed to either run executable or return a token that can be used for impersonation or lateral movement.  This makes it useful to ether run or simply import into another application.
